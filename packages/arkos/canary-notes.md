# Canary Notes

## TODO

### Add

- add context ({req, res, next}) to base service instances on auto generated api endpoints
- add an endpoint with available actions together their own resources to easy frontend
- change .middlewares to .interceptor - as it is basically working just like a reference (router alike) when using array of middlewares which will be used on most project. also allowing devs to use .middlewares to actually store the middlewares functions.

### Change

### Fix

### Remove

- available-routes endpoint as there is already swagger docs

### Deprecate

## DONE
