# Request Handling Pipeline

In **Arkos**, each incoming request goes through a **modular middleware pipeline** that is dynamically constructed based on the Prisma model and its configuration. This allows you to hook into every stage of the request lifecycle without rewriting boilerplate or logic.

This pipeline is automatically applied per route for every registered model and operation (e.g., `createOne`, `findMany`, `deleteMany`, etc.), ensuring that every request is authenticated (if desired), validated, processed, and responded to in a consistent and customizable way.

:::note
This is an explanation on how **Arkos** handles each prisma model request, this is not something you need to implement by yourself unless you want, but by doing this you would not being levarage **Arkos** and it's core features.
:::

## 1. Route Middleware Structure

Each route in **Arkos** is composed of a **chain of middlewares** that execute sequentially. Here's how the flow is constructed:

```ts
// some code here
router.post('/api/posts', middleware1, middleware2, ..., finalHandler);
```

Arkos does this programmatically for every route generated based on your prisma models.

### Example:

For a `POST /api/users` request, the flow might look like:

1. `Authentication Middleware`
2. `Access Control Middleware`
3. `Validation & Transformation Middleware`
4. `Query Parsing Middleware`
5. `Pre-handler Middleware` (optional)
6. `Main Handler`
7. `Post-handler Middleware` (optional)
8. `Response Sender`

## 2. Execution Order

For every endpoint, **Arkos** evaluates and composes middleware like so:

### 2.1. **Authentication**

Ensures the request is coming from a valid, authenticated user if request is activated for the current route, [read more](/docs/advanced-guide/static-rbac-authentication#using-auth-config-to-customize-endpoint-behavior) about how to customize.

```ts
authService.handleAuthenticationControl(...)
```

### 2.2. **Authorization**

Checks if the authenticated user has permission to perform the action on the specific model, [read more](/docs/advanced-guide/static-rbac-authentication#using-auth-config-to-customize-endpoint-behavior) about how to customize.

```ts
authService.handleAccessControl(...)
```

### 2.3. **Validation & Transformation**

Validates the request body using either `Zod` or `class-validator` and transforms it accordingly, [read more](/docs/core-concepts/request-data-validation) about how to work with validation in **Arkos**.

```ts
handleRequestBodyValidationAndTransformation(...)
```

### 2.4. **Custom Prisma Query Options Injection**

Injects your Prisma-specific options like filtering, ordering, pagination, etc., into the request, [read more](/docs/advanced-guide/custom-prisma-query-options) about how to inject your own custom prisma query options on the generated api routes.

```ts
addPrismaQueryOptionsToRequestQuery(...)
```

### 2.5. **Custom Model-Specific Interceptor Middlewares**

Each model can define `before*` and `after*` middlewares for custom logic. **Arkos** checks and applies them automatically:

```ts
middlewares?.beforeCreateOne;
middlewares?.afterCreateOne;
```

These interceptors middlewares let you inject logic such as business rules, analytics, or external service calls **before or after** the core handler runs, [read more](/docs/core-concepts/interceptor-middlewares) how to implement this.

### 2.6. **Core Handler**

The default database operation (e.g., `createOne`, `findMany`, etc.) is executed by the `BaseController` which you can read more about [clicking here](/docs/api-reference/the-base-controller-class).

```ts
createOne, findOne, updateMany, etc.
```

### 2.7. **sendResponse**

This is the fallback and final middleware. If no custom response is sent earlier, it will format and send the standard Arkos response format.

```ts
sendResponse;
```

## 3. Dynamic Route Assembly

All routes are auto-generated from your models. For each model:

- Resource paths are automatically pluralized
- CRUD operations are scaffolded using the Prisma client
- Custom middlewares per model are loaded
- Full security, validation, and query parsing pipelines are constructed

Example route:

```
POST /api/users;
```

Becomes automatically:

```ts
router.post(
  "/api/users",
  authService.handleAuthenticationControl(...),
  authService.handleAccessControl(...),
  handleRequestBodyValidationAndTransformation(...),
  addPrismaQueryOptionsToRequestQuery(...),
  middlewares?.beforeCreateOne ?? createOne,
  middlewares?.beforeCreateOne ? createOne : middlewares?.afterCreateOne ?? sendResponse,
  middlewares?.afterCreateOne ?? sendResponse,
  sendResponse
);
```

This above is an **Arkos** inner implementation if you want to add your own routers, see how to add your own routes endpoints that goes beyond the auto generated by **Arkos**, reading [Adding Custom Routers Guide](/docs/guide/adding-custom-routers).

## 4. Interceptor Middleware For Override & Extension

You can fully customize the pipeline by defining any of the following interpcetor middlewares in your model module:

```ts
// src/modules/[model-name]/[mode-name].middlewares.ts
import { catchAsync } from "arkos/error-handler"

export const beforeCreateOne = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => { ... })
export const afterCreateOne = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => { ... })
```

See exactly how it works [here](/docs/core-concepts/interceptor-middlewares).

## Summary

**Arkos** provides a **structured, extensible request handling pipeline** for every route:

- Consistent across models
- Customizable with interceptor middlewares
- Security-first with built-in auth
- Integrated with Prisma query features

This system enables you to scale your API with confidence while maintaining complete control over every request.
