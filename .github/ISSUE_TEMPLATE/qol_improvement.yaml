        Quality of Life improvements make Arkos.js more pleasant to use! These are typically small but impactful changes.

      label: Current Experience
      description: Describe the current behavior that could be improved
      placeholder: |
        Currently, when generating a new component with the CLI, I have to type the full path every time.
        For example: `npx arkos generate service posts --path src/modules/blog/posts`

      description: How would you improve this experience?
      placeholder: |
        It would be nice if the CLI could remember the last used path or detect the module structure automatically.
        
        Or even better, prompt with a list of existing modules:
        ```
        ? Select target module: 
        ‚ùØ src/modules/blog
          src/modules/users
          src/modules/auth
          [Create new module]
        ```

      placeholder: |
        I generate new components multiple times per day. This would save 10-15 seconds each time,
        and reduce errors from typos in paths.

        BananaJs CLI has a similar feature where it auto-detects module structure.
        Rails generators also remember your preferences.
